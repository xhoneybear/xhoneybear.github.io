# Personal website
Well, this is my old website. It's written in pure HTML/CSS/JS and will probably be in a permanent WIP state since I'm moving to Svelte web development. It's kind of buggy on mobiles as well but now you can use it and it doesn't really look that bad I think.

## Goals
- [x] Make it responsive
- [x] Optimize (gallery slider)
- [ ] Improve accessibility
- [ ] Rethink single-page idea

- [x] Reimagine project tiles

- [ ] Add weather widget on main page
