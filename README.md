# Personal website
Well, this is my website ðŸ˜‡ It's pretty much in heavy WIP state and might be unoptimized, it's kind of buggy on mobiles as well but now you can use it and it doesn't really look that bad I think

## Goals
- [x] Make it responsive
- [ ] Optimize (gallery slider)
- [ ] Improve accessibility
- [ ] Rethink single-page idea
- [ ] Rewrite contact info
- [ ] Design blog timeline
- [ ] Design 404 page
- [x] Reimagine project tiles
- [x] Code blog/project tile generators
- [ ] Add weather widget on main page
- [ ] Replace generators with GitHub Actions
- [ ] Add a bunch of photos of me

I guess that's it
