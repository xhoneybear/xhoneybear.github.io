# Personal website
Well, this is my website ðŸ˜‡ It's pretty much in heavy WIP state and might be unoptimized, it's definitely not suited for mobile devices yet either (it looks really crappy. lol)

## Goals
- [ ] Make it responsive
- [ ] Optimize (gallery slider)
- [ ] Rethink single-page idea
- [ ] Rewrite contact info
- [ ] Design blog timeline
- [ ] Reimagine project tiles
- [ ] Code blog/project tile generators
- [ ] Add a bunch of photos of me

I guess that's it
